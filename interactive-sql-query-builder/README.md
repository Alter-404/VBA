# SQL Query Translator in VBA

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "SQL Query Translator in VBA" project. This project was developed by Thomas BEN MOUBAMBA, Tayssir BEN YOUSSEF, and Mariano BENJAMIN. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient tool that allows users to create and execute SQL queries through an interactive menu in Excel, without requiring prior knowledge of VBA or SQL.

## Preamble
This project aims to provide a practical solution for querying a database in an ergonomic manner. The user interface is designed as a UserForm, offering better organization and increased customization compared to a simple Excel sheet.

## Features
- **User Interface**: A UserForm with 6 pages for clear organization of choices and settings.
- **SQL Connection**: Uses the ADODB library to establish a connection with the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Query Generation**: Dynamically builds SQL queries based on user-provided parameters.
- **Result Export**: Exports the results of SQL queries to a CSV or Excel file.
- **Conditions and Sorting**: Allows specifying conditions and sorting methods for SQL queries.
- **Database Selection**: Choose the Excel workbook and sheet containing the database.
- **Output Format**: Choose the output format (CSV or Excel) and save the results in a dated file.
